# Statkraft hack day
**June 27, 2018, 07:00 Zulu Time**

Welcome to the robot rover challenge. We have bought four Raspberry Pi robot rovers. Your mission is to assemble and program these beauties in such a way that they can maneuver in a maze, _without_ the teams steering them. There are several challenges that will earn you and your team infinite hacker credit points:

 * Shortest time for finishing five laps
 * Least energy spent for finishing five laps
 * Best real time visualization during rover operation
 * First rover to draw a correct map of the path taken through the maze, measured in maze lap coordinates
 * Fallback challenge: If things go south, which rover travels longest distance in maze lap coordinates

Please note that, although we provide everything that is needed to complete the challenge, the teams are allowed to pimp their rides any way they desire. Honking horns? Extra eyes? Blinking lights? Bring it on! Extra pimping gives street cred, and that counts.

## Committee
 * Hacker(name='Ola', affilication=Affiliation.ExpertAnalytics)
 * Hacker(name='Eivind LM', affilication=Affiliation.Statkraft)

The committee is responsible for building a maze, and provide the needed infrastructure and documentation. We will _not_ participate in the challenge directly.

Please note that we must use Python 2.x this time. Unless someone ports the library to Python3 prior to the hack day, that is ;)
